# Machine_Learning_Projects
This is a ML projects on Salary Prediction of an employee using Linear Regression.
This is team project.
Data  Collection:  Gathered a comprehensive  dataset  containing  relevant  features  such  as  education  level, years of experience, and job title , alongside corresponding salary information. 
Data Preprocessing:   Cleaned  and  prepared the  data  by   handling  missing  values,  encoding  categorical variables, and scaling numerical features to ensure uniformity across the dataset. 
Feature  Selection: Identified   key  features impacting   salary  through  exploratory  data  analysis  and  selected a subset of influential variables for model training. 
Train-Test  Split:  Divided  the  dataset  into  training  and  testing  sets  to assess   the  models'  generalisation performance accurately. 
Linear  Regression:  Implemented  a  linear  regression  model  to  establish  a  baseline  for  salary  prediction, considering the linear relationship between features and salary. 
Model  Training  and  Evaluation: 	 Trained  each  model  on  the  training  set,  fine-tuning  hyperparameters,  and  evaluated  their  performance  using  metrics  like  Mean  Squared  Error  (MSE)  or  R-squared on the test set.
